Format:

* Each cell: [IPA][B notation][hiragana]
* Upper case
* Order by hiragana

Column [k] K/か:

* (Plosive) Velar consonant, the back part of the tongue against the soft palate.
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velar_consonant
* In many Japanese dialects, the muddy/dakuon variance が, ぎ, ぐ, げ, ご can all be pronounced with nasal variance, which is not reflected in the writing.
    * 長 na-**ng**a (JP)

Column [t] T/た:

* (Plosive) Alveolar consonant, the tongue against or close to the superior alveolar ridge.
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alveolar_consonant
* Variances:
    * [l] L/ら:
        * Lateral approximant.
        * Commonly used in many languages.
        * In Japanese romaji, L is commonly spelled as R, it really pronounces as L.
        * saku**r**a (JP)
    * [θ] TH:
        * Dental consonant, the tongue against the upper teeth.
        * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_consonant
        * Most common in English. Many English dialects cannot pronounce this accurately and replace it with S (in East Asia) or T (in South Asia).
        * pa**th** (EN)

Column [tɕ] Q/ち:

* (Fricative) Palatal consonant, the body of the tongue raised against the hard palate.
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palatal_consonant
* The first 3 rows are common in Chinese and Japanese, uncommon in English.
* In Japanese romaji, Q is spelled as chi, but it's not **chea**p (EN), it's 七 (CH). Similarly, X is spelled as shi, but it's not **she** (EN), it's 西 (CH).
* The nasal variance GN needs to be distinguished from N.
    * N:
        * fi**n**ish (EN)
    * GN:
        * **n**ews (EN)
        * a**nn**ual (EN)
        * espa**gn**ol (FR)
        * espa**ñ**a (ES)

Column [ts] C/TS/つ:

* (Fricative) Alveolar consonant, the tongue against or close to the superior alveolar ridge.
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alveolar_consonant
* In Japanese romaji, S is spelled as su, TS is spelled as tsu, but none of them should have **u** or **oo** sound. S should be 四 (CH), TS should be 次 (CH).
* The nasal variance NZ is only theoretical. I haven't seen any language using it.

Column [tʃ] CH/TR:

* (Fricative) Postalveolar consonant, the tongue near or touching the back of the alveolar ridge.
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postalveolar_consonant
* [ʒ] = [ʃ] + [dʒ]
    * Even though English IPA has a separate symbol for [ʒ], I would treat it as a combination of [ʃ] + [dʒ].
    * vi**s**ion (EN)
* The nasal variance NR is only theoretical. I haven't seen any language using it.

Column [p] P/ぱ:

* (Plosive) Bilabial consonant, articulated with both lips.
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilabial_consonant
* In many Spanish dialects, V is pronounced as B.
* Variances:
    * [w] W/わ:
        * Similar to V, but need to fully close the mouth instead of the upper teeth touching the lower lip.
        * **wh**ere (EN)

Trill consonant:
* Trill consonant, a consonantal sound produced by vibrations between the active articulator and passive articulator.
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trill_consonant
* It's commonly used in many western languages, such as Spanish and Russian. The matrix is mainly based on Japanese and hence doesn't cover it.
* It can be tricky for speakers who are based on languages that don't have it, such as Chinese and English.
* Variances:
    * H based: French
        * Can be pronounced as H without much misunderstanding.
        * **r**ouge (FR)
    * L based: Spanish
        * Can be pronounced as L or R without much misunderstanding.
        * aho**r**a (ES)
    * R based: Russian
        * Can be pronounced as R without much misunderstanding.
        * **р**усский (RU)
