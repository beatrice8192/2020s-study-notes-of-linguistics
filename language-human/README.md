### Tips for beginners

1. Sing. Why is singing a good way to learn a language?
    * It is more interesting than reading books.
    * The lyrics are composed and approved by speakers who are more native than you do.
      They usually come with translations on the internet.
    * You are going to learn new words, phrases, and expressions.
    * You are going to adjust your pronounciations and rhythms while listening to the recordings.
      These are the most difficult to achieve when learning languages from textbooks.

1. Play games, both board games and video games.

1. The first 1000 vocabulary is more important than conjugating sentences.
    * You can only acquire 2-10 new vocabulary per day.
    * After each lesson, you are going to increase your vocabulary by 100.
    * Vocabulary checkpoints:
        * 1000:     beginner,       can travel without translators.
        * 5000:     intermediate,   can read literatures.
        * 10000:    fluent,         can live in a foreign country.
        * 20000:    native.
    * Dictionary cracking:
        * Find an oxford mini dictionary. Read from end to end.
          The effect of each round is not significant, but it accumulates.
        * 15 mins / (1/4) of a letter.
        * 24 hours / language / round.

1. Find a grammar book. Follow the structure of that book.

1. Learn by comparison. Always learn 2-3 similar languages at a time.
