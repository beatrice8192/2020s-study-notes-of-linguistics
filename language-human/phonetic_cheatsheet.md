# Phonetic Cheatsheet

Overview:

* This page is mainly based on _Chinese_, _Japanese_, _English_.
* It is expanded to cover pronunciations in _German_, _French_, _Spanish_.
* Even though each language has its unique variance for almost every phonetic sound it makes, this guide attempts to _quantify_, _approximate_, _compare_, and _summarize_ the sounds across multiple languages.
    * Quantify: Instead of using literal descriptions, I prefer to imagine the sounds that are the furthest apart as a _graph_, and insert nodes using _mathematical formula_.
        * For example:
        * [A] = [B] + [C], each of [B] and [C] composes 50%.
        * [A] = [[B] + [C]] + [D], each of [B] and [C] composes 25%.
    * Approximate: This is an important skill to possess as a foreign speaker. An approximation is considered _safe_ if it doesn't introduce much misunderstanding under _context_.
    * Compare: I would include as many _references_ and _examples_ as possible, if the same sound is produced across multiple languages.
    * Summarize: I would include as many _tables_ and _diagrams_ as possible, instead of using single dimensional lists.

Format:

* Each cell: [IPA][B notation][hiragana]
* Upper case
* Order by hiragana

**Column [k] `K`/か:**

* (Plosive) Velar consonant, the back part of the tongue against the soft palate.
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velar_consonant
* [ç] = [h] + [k]
    * This variance is found in German and French.
    * Aa**ch**en (DE)
    * Leipzi**g** (DE)
* [ŋ] `NG` usage:
    * Western Europe: uncommon, but exists.
        * si**ng**er (EN)
    * Eastern Asia: common.
        * In many Japanese dialects, the muddy/dakuon variance `G` (が, ぎ, ぐ, げ, ご) can all be pronounced with nasal variance `NG`, which is not reflected in the writing.
        * 長 na-**ng**a (JP)
        * Cantonese:

**Column [t] `T`/た:**

* (Plosive) Alveolar consonant, the tongue against or close to the superior alveolar ridge.
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alveolar_consonant
* [l] `L`/ら variance:
    * Lateral approximant.
    * Commonly used in many languages.
    * Japanese romaji spells (ら, り, る, れ, ろ) as R, but they pronounce the same as `L` in Chinese and English.
    * saku**r**a (JP)

**Column [tɕ] `Q`/ち:**

* (Fricative) Palatal consonant, the body of the tongue raised against the hard palate.
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palatal_consonant
* [tɕ] `Q`/ち, [dʑ] `J`/じ, [ɕ] `X`/し usage:
    * Western Europe: uncommon.
    * Eastern Asia: common.
        * In Japanese romaji, `Q`/ち is spelled as "chi", but it's not "**chea**p" (EN), it's "七" (CH) [tɕi] `Qi`. Similarly, `X`/し is spelled as "shi", but it's not "**shee**p" (EN), it's "西" (CH) [ɕi] `Xi`.

**Column [ts] C/`TS`/つ:**

* (Fricative) Alveolar consonant, the tongue against or close to the superior alveolar ridge.
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alveolar_consonant
* In Japanese romaji, `S`/す is spelled as "su", `TS`/つ is spelled as "tsu", but none of them should have any "**u**" or "**oo**" sound. `S`/す should be 四 (CH) [sɹ̩], `TS`/つ should be 次 (CH) [tsɹ̩].
* The nasal variance `NZ` is only theoretical. I haven't seen any language using it.

**Column [tʃ] CH/`TR`:**

* (Fricative) Postalveolar consonant, the tongue near or touching the back of the alveolar ridge.
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postalveolar_consonant
* [ʒ] = [ʃ] + [dʒ]
    * Even though English IPA has a separate symbol for [ʒ], I would treat it as a combination of [ʃ] + [dʒ].
    * vi**s**ion (EN)
* [tʃ] `TR`, [dʒ] `DR`, [ɹ] `R` usage:
    * English `TR`: common, generated by "tr" or "ch".
        * **ch**ess (EN) [tʃ]
        * **tr**y (EN) [tʃɹ]
    * English `DR`: common, generated by "dr" or "str", but not "zh".
        * **dr**ess (EN) [dʒɹ]

    * Chinese `R`: common, generated by "r".

**Column [p] `P`/ぱ:**

* (Plosive) Bilabial consonant, articulated with both lips.
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilabial_consonant
* [w] `W`/わ variance:
    * Similar to `V`, but need to fully close the mouth instead of the upper teeth touching the lower lip.
    * **wh**ere (EN)
    * English: has both `W` and `V`.
    * French:
    * Spanish:
    * Chinese and Japanese: has `W` only.
* In many Spanish dialects, `V` is pronounced as `B`.

    * Arabic: common.

**Trill consonant [r] `RH`:**

* Trill consonant, a consonantal sound produced by vibrations between the active articulator and passive articulator.
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trill_consonant
* Europe:
    * Common in many languages, such as Spanish and Russian, except English.
    * French variance: `H` based.
        * [r] = [[h] + [k]] + trill
        * **r**ouge (FR)
    * Russian variance: `R` based. (TODO: Study this)
        * **р**усский (RU)
    * Spanish variance: `L`/`R` based.
        * "r" = [r] + trill
        * "rr" = [r] + more trill
        * Depending on the context, it can be approximated as either `L` or `R`.
        * As `R` if it's at the beginning of word.
            * **r**oja (ES)

### Consonants disambiguations

Distinguish `E`/え, `Y`/い, `W`/う:

* `E` initiates vowels like `a`/あ, `e`/え, `o`/お.
* Both `Y` and `W` can initiate other vowels too.
    * **oo**ze (EN) `Eu` is different from **woo**l (EN) `Wu`.
    * **ea**sy (EN) `Ei` is different from **y**ankee (EN) `Yi`.
* `Eu` and `Ei` are more commonly used in Western Europe than Eastern Asia.
* Chinese: 一 is pronounced as `Yi`, 五 is pronounced as `Wu`. There are no inconsistencies.
* Japanese: い is generally pronounced as `Yi`, う is generally pronounced as `Wu`, even though they are classified as vowels and there are inconsistencies in the pronunciations.

Distinguish [l] `L`, [n] `N`, [ɹ] `R`, [r] `RH`:
